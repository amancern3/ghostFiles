APP DOES NOT DEPLOY WELL ON GCLOUD !!! FIX 

== Sept 5, 2022 ==

might rename to "THE DUMP"

need to figure out how to send images on gcloud html req

created new branch: gcloud-fix to nail down sending and rendering files/data/images.

GETTING IMAGE TO DISPLAY HAS BEEN A PAIN. 

I believe it is not a gcloud thing ? Maybe being to route and upload the picture might be it. 
Since the directory in the website doesn't seem to exit. Need to figure out how to debug. 

Is this a node problem ? I don't think so, the img renders locally. -> might be a gcloud thing.

The problem: Assets were not uploading 

Sol: upload Assets. 

Yep... for some reason my entire dir was not uploading, found it through the 'Source' tab in the dev brave-console. 
Was easy enough from there.

TO DO: 
    -Clean file structure
    -Rename project
    -Clean code at all ?
