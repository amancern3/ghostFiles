APP DOES NOT DEPLOY WELL ON GCLOUD !!! FIX 

== Sept 5, 2022 ==

might rename to "THE DUMP"

need to figure out how to send images on gcloud html req

created new branch: gcloud-fix to nail down sending and rendering files/data/images.

GETTING IMAGE TO DISPLAY HAS BEEN A PAIN. 

I believe it is not a gcloud thing ? Maybe being to route and upload the picture might be it. 
Since the directory in the website doesn't seem to exit. Need to figure out how to debug. 

Is this a node problem ? I don't think so, the img renders locally. -> might be a gcloud thing.

The problem: Assets were not uploading 

Sol: upload Assets. 

Yep... for some reason my entire dir was not uploading, found it through the 'Source' tab in the dev brave-console. 
Was easy enough from there.

TO DO: 
    -Clean file structure (moving all static files to assets) 
    -Rename project (X) -- too large scale of a change rn 
    -Clean code at all ? 

    File structure:- move ever ext to its own dir. 


Made new branch to clean-up file struct, it broke the gcloud deployment
Also locally, need to figure out why 'live' server works on html but not js,

Also what is the order of execution ?? If that is found out, and how to debug on dev console
it will be easier to debug and fix the restruct of files

Fixing gcloud deployment 


Might make a single webpage, with blog date entries, ordered list with contact funtionality 

Webpage idea: crimewatch for city per custom mile radius. (&&) could be just daily updates for the city in question and send an SMS ? 

gcloud-fix is the only stable branch
